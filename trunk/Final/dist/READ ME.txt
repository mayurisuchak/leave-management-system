Before using the system:
    1. Run SQL script (if using DBServer, do this step on server):
             - Run SQL Managerment Studio
             - Open file LeaveManagementSystem.sql
             - Run this script (press F5)
             - Close SQL Management Studio
    2. Configure property file (if using DBServer, use this step on client):
             - Edit file properties.prop by Notepad
             - Edit row: "server = localhost" to "server = ####" (#### is DBServer name)
             - Edit row: "port = 1433" to "port = ####" (#### is the port that DBServer uses)
             - Save this file and close

Now, you can try our system by double click to the file: LeaveManagementSystem.jar

Enjoy!!!
